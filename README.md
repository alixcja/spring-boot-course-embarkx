# Spring Boot Learning Journey 🌱
This repository contains my journey of learning **Spring Boot** by following the Udemy course:
🎓 **[Spring Boot Microservices Professional eCommerce Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-spring-boot-microservices-with-spring-cloud-k8s-docker/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)** by **Faisal Memeom (EmbarkX)**.
The goal is to understand the core concepts of Spring Boot by building real-world projects and experimenting with code.

## 📚 What I will (hopefully) learn

- Build a real-world eCommerce microservices application using Spring Boot 3.
- Develop core services like product, user, order, and payment.
- Secure your architecture with JWT, OAuth2, and Keycloak.
- Use Spring Cloud components like Eureka, Config Server, and Gateway.
- Manage data with JPA, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- Containerize apps using Docker and deploy with Kubernetes.
- Implement inter-service communication (RestTemplate, OpenFeign).
- Monitor and trace services with Zipkin and Micrometer.
- Apply resilience patterns using Resilience4J.
- Transition from monolith to microservices architecture.
- Work with multi-container setups and CI/CD practices.

## 🎯 Current Progress

- **20/06/2025**: Completed Courses 2 and 3
- **22/06/2025**: Finished Course 4 – Added a simple controller and service classes for user management

## 📖 Notes
This is a learning repository — code may evolve, refactor, or break as I explore new concepts. All code is based on or inspired by the Udemy course linked above.

🧠 “Learning by doing” is the best way to master backend development.
